Number of tiles:
- 2 players, 9 tiles per player
- 3 to 4 players, 7 tiles
- 5 to 6 players, 6 tiles

Place them on your rack, with the numbered side up, so you can see them.
For getting the first player, there are different ways.

**First variant:**
All players are picking up a tile from the “well” and the player with the highest valued stone begins. This player places a random tile from the well as his first play.

**Second variant:**
The player with the highest valued stone, with three of the same numbers (e.g. 5 - 5 -5, then 4 - 4 - 4, and so on) on his rack, begins by playing this stone out as his first play.";

It is important to ensure that all three corners fit, if you place a tile in between other tiles.

If the player on turn can’t or does not want to place a tile, he has to buy one from the well.

This will lead to 5 penalty points for each bought tile. It is possible to buy three tiles per round. If you can’t place a tile after buying 3, you get another 10 penalty points (25 total for this round), and the next player is on turn.

If you can place a tile after buying, the value of this tile is added to the penalty points (e.g. -10 + 8 → -2 points for this turn.)";

4. Three hexagons at the same time - 70 points.";
