# TriomiCount
This is my first bigger project. Currently I'm working on it as my main project, while learning.
TriomiCount is used to track the state of the games while playing the boardgame [Triominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triominoes).

It basically is a kind of dominoes but with triangle shaped tiles.

## What can I do with this?
Key features right now:
* add and list players
* show details about single players *(e.g. highscores, last score, games played, games won, etc.)*
* track a game of *n* players *(singleplayer games are also possible)*
* show games *(work in progress)*
* light / dark mode

## Why something niche like this!?
I like playing the game, but was annoyed that I'd to write down our scores by hand and the next time we'd played, the last scores were gone.

I'm far more interested in building something â€“Â atleast for us â€“ useful, than the next to-do app. ðŸ™ƒ
